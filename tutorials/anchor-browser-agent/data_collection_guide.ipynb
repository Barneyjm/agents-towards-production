    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern AI agents often need to interact with web applications that were designed for human users rather than programmatic access. While many services offer APIs, a significant portion of critical business data remains locked behind web interfaces - dashboards, monitoring tools, and administrative panels that require browser-based interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anchor Browser Agent addresses this challenge by providing a cloud-based browser automation platform specifically designed for AI agents. Unlike traditional web scraping tools that rely on fragile selectors and require extensive maintenance, Anchor leverages built-in AI capabilities to understand and interact with web interfaces contextually.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide demonstrates how to build a robust data collection system that can extract structured information from complex web dashboards, using Grafana as our primary example. The techniques covered here apply broadly to any web-based monitoring or administrative interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Approach Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional web automation approaches face several critical limitations:\n",
    "- **Maintenance Overhead**: CSS selectors break when interfaces change\n",
    "- **Scale Challenges**: Managing browser infrastructure is complex and costly\n",
    "- **Dynamic Content**: JavaScript-heavy applications often require sophisticated timing and interaction patterns\n",
    "- **Anti-Bot Detection**: Modern websites employ increasingly sophisticated bot detection mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "Anchor Browser Agent solves these problems by providing enterprise-grade browser automation as a service, with AI-powered navigation that adapts to interface changes and handles complex interaction patterns automatically."

    " ## Key Benefits and Capabilities\n",
    " \n",
    " Anchor Browser Agent offers:\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Cloud-based browsers**: No local setup - sessions run in isolated, reliable cloud environments.\n",
    " - **AI-powered web interaction**: Use natural language instructions instead of fragile selectors ([docs](https://docs.anchorbrowser.io/agentic-browser-control/ai-task-completion?utm_source=agents-towards-production)).\n",
    " - **Advanced session management**: Persist authentication, customize browser fingerprints, and control timeouts ([docs](https://docs.anchorbrowser.io/api-reference/browser-sessions/start-browser-session?utm_source=agents-towards-production)).\n",
    " - **Proxy & geo support**: Access geo-restricted content and avoid rate limits with residential/mobile proxies ([docs](https://docs.anchorbrowser.io/advanced/proxy?utm_source=agents-towards-production)).\n",
    " - **Session recording**: Record browser sessions for debugging and compliance ([docs](https://docs.anchorbrowser.io/essentials/recording?utm_source=agents-towards-production)).\n",
    " - **Profile management**: Persist browser identities for complex authentication flows ([docs](https://docs.anchorbrowser.io/essentials/authentication-and-identity?utm_source=agents-towards-production))."

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./assets/data-collection-diagram.png\" alt=\"Anchor Browser Agent Architecture\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture follows a cloud-native design where your AI agent communicates with remote browser instances through a combination of REST APIs and real-time protocols:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Session Creation**: Your agent uses Anchor's REST API to create configured browser sessions\n",
    "2. **Browser Control**: Direct connection to browser instances via Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)\n",
    "3. **AI Navigation**: Built-in AI agents handle complex web interactions based on natural language instructions\n",
    "4. **Data Extraction**: Structured data is returned to your agent for further processing\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation of concerns allows for both simple automation tasks and sophisticated interaction patterns while maintaining the reliability and scalability required for production systems."

    "## Use Case: Automated Data Collection from Grafana Dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "This section demonstrates a practical implementation of Anchor Browser Agent for extracting structured data from web-based monitoring dashboards. We'll use Grafana as our example, but the principles apply to any dynamic web interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Grafana dashboards present several automation challenges that make them ideal for demonstrating Anchor's capabilities:\n",
    "- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Charts and metrics load asynchronously via JavaScript\n",
    "- **Interactive Elements**: Some data only appears through hover actions or click interactions\n",
    "- **Authentication Requirements**: Production dashboards often require SSO or complex login flows\n",
    "- **Real-Time Updates**: Data refreshes continuously, requiring careful timing considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Value\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated dashboard monitoring enables AI agents to:\n",
    "- Continuously monitor infrastructure health without human intervention\n",
    "- Correlate metrics across multiple monitoring systems\n",
    "- Detect anomalies and patterns that might be missed in manual reviews\n",
    "- Generate automated reports and alerts based on visual dashboard data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Dashboard Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Our example focuses on a Kubernetes monitoring dashboard that displays critical infrastructure metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./assets/grafana-dashboard.png\" alt=\"Example Grafana Dashboard\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This dashboard contains:\n",
    "- Node performance metrics and resource utilization\n",
    "- CPU and memory usage percentages across cluster nodes\n",
    "- Network and storage performance indicators\n",
    "- Alert status and health indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to extract this visual information as structured data that can be processed by downstream AI systems."

    "\n",

    "**Browser Connection**: The `connect_over_cdp` method establishes a direct connection to the cloud browser instance. This provides real-time control capabilities similar to what you would have with a local browser, but with the benefits of cloud infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI Agent Integration**: Anchor's built-in AI agent runs as a service worker within the browser context. This agent has been trained to understand web interfaces and can execute natural language instructions to interact with complex layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Navigation Strategy**: Using `wait_until=\"domcontentloaded\"` ensures the basic page structure is ready before proceeding. The additional sleep period allows time for JavaScript-driven content (like Grafana charts) to render completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Natural Language Instructions**: Instead of writing complex selectors or interaction scripts, you can provide natural language instructions to the AI agent. The agent interprets these instructions contextually and adapts to the specific layout it encounters.\n",

    "### Session Lifecycle Management\n",

This eliminates the need to re-authenticate for each session.\n",

    "### Batch Processing Optimization\n",
