# Agent Security Evaluation Tutorial

## Overview

Learn prompt injection attacks and defenses through hands-on security testing of AI systems. Instead of just reading about vulnerabilities, you'll actually exploit them and then build protections against them using real attack datasets and automated testing tools.


## What You'll Learn

- **Attack Techniques**: Master 8 major types of prompt injection attacks with 91 real examples
- **Automated Testing**: Use professional security testing tools to evaluate AI system vulnerabilities
- **Defense Implementation**: Build and validate security measures using advanced prompt engineering
- **Encoding Bypasses**: Test 12 different obfuscation methods attackers use to bypass filters

## Tutorial

### **[Complete Security Evaluation: agent-security-evaluation-tutorial.ipynb](./agent-security-evaluation-tutorial.ipynb)**
Hands-on tutorial covering attack techniques, automated testing, and defense implementation with real-world examples.

## Quick Start

1. **Install packages**: `pip install openai python-dotenv pandas`
2. **Set up API key**: Create `.env` file with `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`
3. **Run the tutorial**: Complete in 30-45 minutes with automated and manual testing

## Files Included

- **Main tutorial** - Complete security evaluation notebook
