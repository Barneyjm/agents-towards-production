calorify allows you to estimate the calorie count of a meal based on an image of it.
They use our models to identify the individual ingredients and to estimate quantities for them. They then plug into a nutrition facts database and compute the final calorie count.
We do really well on food item recognition as well as quantity estimation.
Where they're complaining is that any image that includes part of a human face throws our models off completely.
A common failure mode for example is that we confuse interpret teeth to be sugar drops rather which means Calorify can't exclude them from the calorie count.
