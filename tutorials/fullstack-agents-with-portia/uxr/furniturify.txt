Furniturify allows people to visualise a piece of furniture they find online in their own house.
Furniturify have been using us for the past six months and finding that our models except at object recognition and collision detection is amazing.
They did flag however that we struggle with placing the furniture in an image that contains people in it. They will send us an example where a sofa was sticking out of a person's mouth in a room for example, rather than being added in the corner of the room as instructed.
