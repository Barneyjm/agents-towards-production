    "# SteelThread Evaluation Framework: Real-Time and Offline Agent Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces SteelThread, Portia AI's closed-source evaluation framework designed for comprehensive assessment of multi-agent systems. The framework provides two complementary evaluation approaches: Streams for real-time production monitoring and Evals for systematic offline testing against reference datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "SteelThread addresses critical challenges in agent evaluation by enabling instant conversion of any agent execution into structured evaluations, eliminating the need for manual dataset curation while providing deterministic, highly structured assessment capabilities built on Portia's Plans and PlanRuns architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology and Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The SteelThread framework operates on two fundamental evaluation paradigms that together provide comprehensive coverage of agent performance assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Streams (Online Evaluations)** represent the real-time monitoring component, designed to sample production agent activity and apply both deterministic and LLM-as-judge evaluators to detect performance trends and behavioral anomalies as they occur. Unlike traditional offline evaluations, Streams operate without ground truth datasets, instead focusing on continuous assessment of live agent interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evals (Offline Evaluations)** provide the systematic testing component, enabling regular assessment of agent systems against curated reference datasets to identify performance regression and ensure consistent reliability over time. This approach follows established evaluation practices while leveraging SteelThread's enhanced tooling for dataset management and evaluation execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework's architecture delivers several key advantages for production agent systems. The ability to transform any agent execution into an evaluation eliminates the traditional bottleneck of manual test case creation, while the structured foundation built on Portia's architecture ensures deterministic and reproducible assessment results. Real-time monitoring capabilities enable immediate detection of performance issues, while offline evaluation provides systematic reliability validation.\n",

    "## Understanding Streams\n",
    "\n",
    "Streams represent the online evaluation component of SteelThread, designed to monitor production agents in real-time without requiring predefined ground truth datasets. This approach enables continuous performance assessment by sampling live agent activity and applying configurable evaluators to detect trends, anomalies, and behavioral changes as they occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sampling-based approach allows for scalable monitoring where you can adjust the sampling rate based on your monitoring requirements, from light oversight to comprehensive real-time analysis. The framework supports both off-the-shelf evaluators and custom evaluation logic tailored to your specific use cases.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "* Select 'Plan Runs' as your Stream source -- SteelThread allows you to monitor Plans more specifically if you wanted to.\n",

The framework simplifies the traditionally complex process of dataset creation and maintenance while providing comprehensive evaluation capabilities.\n",

    "* Adding a test case to the dataset from previous plan runs -- Note that the query and tools will be automatically populated as test case inputs, but you can still edit those.\n",
    "* Configuring your evaluators -- Portia offers a large number of off the shelf evaluators. We will start with some basic ones first:\n",
    "** Final plan run state -- this not only helps you test for a successful plan completion (State = `COMPLETE`), but it also helps you test for plans that should fail or trigger a clarification e.g. for auth.\n",
    "** Tool calls -- you can confirm whether all the tools you expected to be called were indeed called (and include an exclusion set as well e.g. to track tool selection confusion).\n",

When you're in the Plan Runs tab in the dashboard, click on the plan run you want to add to your Eval dataset, and look for the 'Add to Evals' button in the Plan Run view modal.

    "One challenge with using Evals in the multi-agent space is that every time you run your test cases you may run into issues e.g.:\n",

    "SteelThread solves this problem by introducing \"tool stubbing\". With this feature you can override the definition of any tool with custom code. We're going to use it to override the `file_reader_tool` to return a static value rather than try to read a file that may not always be available in the Eval environment.\n",
