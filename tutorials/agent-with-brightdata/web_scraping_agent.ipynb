            "\n",
            "**Dynamic Reasoning**: The agent analyzes each situation and develops a reasoning strategy tailored to the specific task requirements. Rather than following predetermined scripts, it evaluates available information and determines the most effective approach.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Tool Selection**: Based on its reasoning, the agent selects appropriate tools from its available repertoire. This selection process considers factors such as data requirements, website characteristics, and desired output formats.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Iterative Refinement**: The agent can execute multiple actions in sequence, using the results of previous actions to inform subsequent decisions. This capability is particularly valuable for complex web scraping scenarios that require multi-step workflows.\n",

For instance, when encountering an e-commerce site, the agent might recognize the need for structured product data extraction. Conversely, when analyzing news articles, it might prioritize content extraction and summarization techniques.\n",
