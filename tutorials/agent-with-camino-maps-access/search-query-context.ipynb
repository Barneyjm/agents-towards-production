    "# Camino AI: Location Intelligence for AI Agents 🗺️🤖\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on **Camino AI**, a powerful location intelligence API that provides real-world grounding for AI agents. Unlike traditional web search APIs, Camino specializes in spatial reasoning, location-based queries, and journey planning—essential capabilities for agents that need to understand and navigate the physical world.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Makes Camino AI Special?\n",
    "\n",
    "While tools like Tavily excel at web search and content extraction, Camino AI fills a critical gap in the AI agent ecosystem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🌍 Real-World Grounding**: Connect AI agents to actual physical locations using OpenStreetMap data\n",
    "- **🧠 Natural Language Understanding**: Convert queries like \"quiet coffee shops for working\" into structured location data\n",
    "- **📍 Spatial Intelligence**: Calculate routes, distances, travel times, and spatial relationships\n",
    "- **🎯 Context-Aware Search**: Understand intent and context (e.g., \"romantic dinner spot\" vs \"business lunch\")\n",
    "- **🚶 Journey Planning**: Plan multi-stop trips with time and transport constraints\n",
    "- **💰 Cost-Effective**: only $0.001 per call with a generous free tier\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:\n",
    "1. Set up and authenticate with Camino AI\n",
    "2. Perform natural language location searches with AI-powered ranking\n",
    "3. Calculate spatial relationships and routes between locations\n",
    "4. Understand location context and surroundings\n",
    "5. Plan complex journeys with multiple waypoints\n",
    "6. Integrate Camino with AI agents via MCP (Model Context Protocol)\n",
